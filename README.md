# WeatherApp

This app is based on lessons 57-62 of this course: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/windows-10-development-for-absolute-beginners/

Core functionality includes getting data from an API, modifying and displaying it in the form, and getting the users reported location if the user allows.

Some modifications were made, including displaying weather data in both metric and imperial units, as well as changing the app background based on the current temperature.
